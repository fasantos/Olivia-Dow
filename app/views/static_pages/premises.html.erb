      giving her pupils a unique opportunity to perform in public roles which they can safely say were created for them.<br>

    <h3>March 2008 - New additional premises for senior students</h3>
    <%= image_tag "studio2.jpg", alt: "studio_old", class: "grid_5 gama omega" %>
    <p class="grid_7 gama beta">
      As from 2008, the new additional premises: 
      Olivia Dow Dance Academy is just a ‘stone’s throw away’ from the still functional old studio of Olivia Dow School of Russian Ballet in Naxxar.  
      It is mainly used by the increasing number of senior ballet students (Grade IV upwards).  
      This new studio is designed with ‘state of the art’ lighting, non-slip rubber carpet in two rooms and it is multi-mirrored.  
      The concept of this additional location came from the Founder and Artistic Director John Baldacchino known also to the students as Mr. 
      John, who unfortunately passed away in February 2007 prior to its completion.

  <h3 class="grid_12 beta gama omega">General Information</h3>
  <p class="grid_12 alpha beta gama omega">
    The school coaches its students in the famous traditional Russian Classical Ballet - the Legat System and includes in its repertoire Classical ballet 
    classes: ‘en pointe’ level and Inklassico classes which covers both Demi Character lessons and intensive training and stretching exercises for the 
    well-trained senior ballet students.
  </p>
  <p class="grid_12 alpha beta gama omega">
    Beginners are given the first 2 lessons free in order to give the opportunity for both student and parents to assess the ballet school. New students who 
    have experienced ballet elsewhere are more than welcome to the school and would be intergraded in the classes according to Ms. Olivia’s evaluation together 
    with any achieved ballet certificates.
  </p>
  <p class="grid_12 alpha beta gama omega">
    Ballet lessons are held regularly (for both boys and girls) throughout the week including Saturday and students must attend 2 lessons per week 
    (the duration of each lesson is 1 whole hour). As for the senior students, besides the weekly 2 ballet classes, they also have Inklassico lessons on 
    Saturday: a 1½ hour intensive training class.
  </p>
  <p class="grid_12 alpha beta gama omega">
    To help her in the school Olivia Dow is assisted by fully qualified Teachers along with other students who are furthering their ballet teaching course.  
    Ms. Dow manages very well with the ever increasing popularity of the Legat System taught in her ballet school and quite naturally her ‘sought after’ 
    ballet productions by the Ballet Russe de Malte: featuring a cast of students from the Olivia Dow School of Russian Ballet. Short video clips of each 
    and every ballet produced throughout these years could be seen on the school's official website. 
  </p>
  <p class="grid_12 alpha beta gama omega">
    The ballet grades obtained within the school begin from Pre-preparatory level up until the Soloist level. At the beginning of the new term in September 
    most of the students will be in preparation for their ballet examinations, which are held annually in October/November and evaluated by a foreign 
    appointed examiner sent over by the Russian Ballet Society in Edinburgh. When students have achieved their Elementary level they are invited to become 
    associate members of the R. B. Society and it is necessary to update their membership annually if they intend to further their ballet grade especially 
    if the student wishes to take up the teaching course. Senior students must achieve the Advanced level and are members of the R. B. Society for admission 
    to the Teacher Training Programme which is spread over 4 courses: Primary, Junior, Intermediate and Advanced teaching.
